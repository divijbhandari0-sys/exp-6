Theory
Conditional Statements in Python
Conditional statements allow programs to make decisions and execute different code blocks based on specific conditions. Python provides three main types of conditional statements:
1. if Statement

Executes a block of code only if the condition is True
Syntax: if condition:

2. elif Statement

Short for "else if"
Checks additional conditions when the previous if/elif is False
Syntax: elif condition:

3. else Statement

Executes when all previous conditions are False
Syntax: else:

Key Concepts
Comparison Operators:

> (greater than), < (less than)
>= (greater than or equal), <= (less than or equal)
== (equal to), != (not equal to)

Logical Operators:

and - Both conditions must be True
or - At least one condition must be True
not - Reverses the boolean value

Control Flow:
Conditional statements control the flow of program execution by evaluating conditions from top to bottom and executing the first True condition block.
